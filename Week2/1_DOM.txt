DOM : Document Object Model

Basis of HTML5 is "New Features should be based on HTML, CSS, the DOM and Javascript"

DOM provides common tree like structures that all pages should follow

HTMl is built on the DOM
                                            Document
                                                |
                                        Root Element <html>
                                                |
                             ----------------------------------------------
                             |                                             |
                        Element <head>                                 Element <body>
                             |                                     ------------------------
                       Element <title>                                       |            |
                             |                                   Attribute   - Element    Element 
                        Text "my title"                           "href"     - <a>         <h1>
                                                                    |                       |
                                                                Text "my link"               Text "my header"

Three Parts of a well formed Document :
1) Doctype
    Version of HTML that we are using
2) head
    Metadata : Extra Info
3) Body :
    Displayble content

1) Doctype:
HTML5:
    <!DOCTYPE html>

2) Head:
    Additional info used by the browser:
        Meta Data : Language, title (Which we see on the tab of the browser)
        Supporting FIles : Javascript, Styling, Add-ons
    Other than title, metadata is not displayed

3) Body :
    Bulk of our page
    Important to write well formatted (tree-like code). i.e every tag has opening and ending

To validate your code go to https://validator.w3.org

Well Formed tags using DOM structure : 
    Use beginning and end tags
    Close inner tags before outer ones
    Use valid attributes

Browsers will fix bad code but not always well. Use a validator to check your code
