Tags have a beginning and an end

<h1>Hello World</h1>
start          end 

<img src="x.gif" />
Self closing tag 

Some tags have attributes (src, href, etc)

1) Display Attribute :
    One of the most important attribute of any element
    The 2 most common are block and inline

    a) block: Can take width and height
        Newline is inserted before and after it eg, it takes up the whole width
    b) inline : cannot take width and height
        Only uses as much space as needed to contain the element

2) Common Tags:
    a) Headings (block elements)
        <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
        These tags have syntax and sematics
        These tags have semantics becoz text written in <h1> tag is considered to be highly important
    
    b) Paragraph (block element)
        <p>............</p>
        It should only contain inline elements
        So we can write text and insert pictures in a Paragraph
        But we should never put a paragraph inside a paragraph
        We should also never put a heading inside a paragraph

    c) Div Tags (block element):
        Generic section which tends to be larger than a paragraph
        There is no semantic meaning behind a div

3) More Tags:
    a) Ordered Lists: By default, it puts each list item as 1 2 3 ... We can change the kind of numbering of attributes
        <ol>
            <li> Item one </li>
            <li> Item two </li>
        </ol>
    
    b) Unordered Lists : It uses a small circle before each list item. We can change the bullet points using attributes
        <ul>
            <li> Item one </li>
            <li> Item two </li>
        </ul>

    c) Line Break
        <br>
        Browser doesn't put a newline if we just include a newline in the text. It only puts a newline if <br> tag is mentioned.

4) Attributes:
    Attributes provide additional information about an element
    Always specified in the start tag
    They come in name value pairs

5) Images:
    img tag (inline):
    <img src="myPicture.jpg" alt="Image of Coleen"/>
    src attribute : Name of picture is mentioned here
    alt attribute : alternative text. If there is any problem in displaying the picture then this text is shown.

    <img src="logo.jpg"        Image filename
         alt="company logo"    Info for screen readers, broken links
         title="My Title"      Displays on hover  
         class="thumbnail"/>   Extra formatting (height, width, etc)

6) More Attributes:
    a) class : applies special properties to group of elements
    b) id : specifies a unique id to one element on the page, for javascript
    c) style : specifies a certain visual style (avoid this!)
    d) accesskey : a shorcut keyboard key to access that element. Important for accessibility.
    e) tabindex : the order elements will come into focus using the tab key
                    If we want users to go to some important element using tab then we can set a high tab index for it
                    high tab index is actually a smaller number. tabindex="1" is the highest priority

7) Special Entities:
    To print : 
    a) < : &lt;   here lt stands for less than
    b) > : &gt;
    c) Copyright Symbol : &copy;
    d) blank space : &nbsp;
    e) cent : &cent;
    f) & : &amp;
