Using semantic tags:

1)
In the beginning there was div
<div> was a way to group related things together
Divs almost always had special classes/ids associated with them

<div class="header">....</div>
<div class="section">....</div>
<div class="footer">....</div>

2)
Header Tags:
<header>
A group of introductory or navigational aids: title, navigational links, etc.

<header>
    <h1>This is the title</h1>
    <h2>Author is Vishwesh</h2>
</header>

<header> tag is just a block tag, there is nothing special about it. No extra formatting or anything
However it does let the user know that this is the header section

<header> should not be confused with the <head> or the different heading tags
<head> tag is for metadata
<header> tag is more of an aid 

3) 
<nav> tag
A section of the page that links to other pages or to parts within the page
Often found in the <header> tag

<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="">Overview</a></li>
        <li><a href="">History</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Development</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>

4)
<footer> tag
A section that contains info such as copyright data, related documents, and links to social media
Typically at the bottom of the page but not required

<footer>
    &copy; 2015 by Vishwesh Vivek Pujari
    <a href=""></a> 
</footer> 

Footer tag also doesn't have any special meaning. It does not make the text go to the bottom neither

5) 
<figure> tag
Has more semantics than <img>

Can include : 
    a) caption
    b) multiple multi-media resources

<figure>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <figcaption>Enter your caption here</figcaption>
</figure>

This <figcaption> can be shown to someone who cannot see the image

Other new tags:
a) Structural elements:
    article, aside, main, menuitem, summary, section
b) Form elements:
    datalist, keygen, output
c) Input types:
    color, date, email, list
d) Graphics Element:
    canvas, svg
e) Media elements:
    audio, embed, source, track, video

The age of <div> is ending.
