Images : It's more than the tag

1)
Many file types are supported
    JPEG (.jpg and .jpeg), GIF, and PNG
    SVG and BMP are additional options
    File extensions must be included

2)
Every image must be downloaded, so it will have some size. Hence viewers of the webpage also have to load those images.
Hence size of the image can also be a factor for how fast or slow the webpage is.
Every image in our code requires an http request

3) image sizes:
When we link to an image, the browser displays the image as big or small as the file
Solution to above problem : Change the file / use width-height attributes 
We can use paint in windows to change the size of the file

4) Using width and height attributes:
We should always strive to keep style out of our html code.
But <img> tag is an exception, it includes both width and height attributes

<figure>
    <img src="" width="500px" alt="">
    <figcaption> </figcaption>
</figure>

In this case browser determines the height proportionate to the width
We can add both width and height also.

5) Best solution : Use %

<figure>
    <img src="" width="500%" alt="">
    <figcaption> </figcaption>
</figure>

This sets the width to 50% of the size of the browser window and not the size of the picture.
Also using % allows the image to shrink or expand as the size of the screen is changed

6) Favicons:
We can put image/logo/icon next to the title of our page in the title bar
This must go in the head section

<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="file.png"/>

We cannot use jpeg or gif for logos.
It either needs to be a special icon image or a .png

7) Alternative text attributes:
    a) Provides textual alternative to non-text content
    b) Read by screen readers (Screen Readers are essentially to people who are blind)
    c) Displayed in place of images
    d) Provides semantic meaning for search engines

    Creating good alt text:
        Be accurate
        Be succint (briefly and clearly expressed)
        Don't be redundant
        Don't include "picture of.." or "graphic of..."

    Empty alt text:
        It's okay to leave alt text empty (null)
            Decorative images used for non-informative purposes
        But do not skip the alt tag!
        Write alt=""
        Writing empty alt tells the user that we haven't forgotten to add it, instead we didn't want to.
