Links are what make the web a web

The interlinked nature of the web leads to the "knowledge" that search engines appear to have

Anchor Links:
    <a> tag
    <a href="https://www.google.com">Content</a>
    The <a> stands for anchor links
    href : hyper-reference : location of new content
    <a> tag needs a hyper-reference and Content
    content : The clickable part (text or image)

Types of links:
    Absolute Links
    Relative
    Internal
    Graphical

1) Absolute reference:
	<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>
	We need to provide a complete url in case of absolute reference
 	this link is used when we want to link to a different others page

2) Relative reference:
	a) href="page2.html"
	page2.html is present in the same folder
	b) href="docs/page2.html"
	page2.html is present in the docs directory
	c) <a href="#history">History Section</a>
	This makes use of id tag
	Link to a different history location in the same file

3) Benefits of local / relative links:
	Even if we move our project directory from one place to another, we don't have to rename everything

4) Links should never have folders that are specific to our computer
	eg C:\page2.html

5) Using images as link:
	The clickable component doesn't have to be text
	It can be an img
	<a><img></a>

6) Usability Issues:
	Make sure that the clickable component has an informative name
	Info in the images should be available to those who can't see the image (i.e alt text)

7) Embedded links
	Use <div id="first">
		This is the first content
	    </div>
	    <a href="#first">First section</a>

8) Targets:
	Anchors can take a target attribute:
		_self : default one. Opens the hyperlink in the same tab
		_blank : opens in new tab
		_top and _parent

A page without link is extremely rare
# marks make links internal

<a href="wikipedia.org"> gives an error
This is bcoz browser tries to look at wikipedia.org file in the same folder
