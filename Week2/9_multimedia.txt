Multimedia : Video and Audio

1) <video> tag uses a src attribute or embedded <source>, similar to img

Common attributes:
	height, width (height and width of video)
	autoplay (whether or not to autoplay the video when page loads)
	loop (loop the video)
	controls. Always include controls in the video. So that user can start stop the video
	controls and loops are like boolean attributes. They don't take any value

Text inside <video>..</video> is displayed if browser cannot support tag

2) <audio> tag uses a src attribute to link to audio file typically .mp3 or .wav

Common Attributes:
	autoplay, controls, loop
	buffered
	muted
	volume

3) Setting clips
	We can play clips by adding to the src attribute
	.ext#t=5,25     from 5 secs to 25 secs only
	.ext#t=,25      from beginning to 25 secs
	.ext#t=,1:38:45
	.ext#t=42       from 42 secs to end

4) Accessibilty issues:
	Make sure to provide links to plugins
	Include text description and close calptioning
